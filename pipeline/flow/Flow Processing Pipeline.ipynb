    "<font color=red> The goal of this notebook is to associate the raw ADT ground-data for 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019, and the raw speed ground-data in 2015 to the Aimsun network for the calibration of Aimsun simulations. First the raw data is processed in a common format, then, every detector is associated with a network link inside Aimsun. Later, every detector is associated with a road section to create heatmap and understand the evolution of flows over years. </font>\n"
