    "    - ***Edson Question***: There are columns that are ambiguous \"Flow (Veh/5 Minutes)\", \"# Lane Points\" and \"% Observed\". That is I don't know what they represent exactly. For example, \"Flow (Veh/5 Minutes)\" does not specify if it belongs to some Lane or if its a combination of the previous lane flows.\n",
    "    ***Theo Answer***: what matter is \"Flow (Veh/5 Minutes)\": the number of vehicles seen for every lane of the corresponding detectors and \"% Observed\": how much of the flow is due to real vehicles sensed or due to estimation form other days due to a technical issue that make the sensor not sensing every cars. \n",

    "\n",
    "The city files are in folder named \"Year ADT Data\" where Year takes values of 2013, 2015, 2017 or 2019. Almost every file is named using the convention \"Main Road Cross 1 Cross 2 Direction\". Main Road is the road on which the flow is recorded, Cross 1 and Cross 2 can be used to locate the sensor which is found between the intersection of the main road and road Cross 1 and the intersection of the main road and road Cross 2, and finally the Direction gives the direction of the flow such as \"EB\" which stands for East Bound. Note that files in \"Year ADT Data\" folder are of file type .xls, .xlsx, .csv and .pdf.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***2013 Excel files*** are structured in data sheets. The first data sheet \"Summary\" contains the main road, cross streets, city information and the start date of the recording. It also summarizes the data contained in all other sheets into a bar plot of traffic flow vs time of day bins (i.e Tuesday AM, Wednesday PM) for different flow directions and into a line plot of traffic flow vs. hour of day for different days of the week. The sheets that follow are named \"D1\", \"D2\",...\"DN\" where N denotes the N'th day since the start date. These sheets are structured into two tables, AM counts and PM counts. Each table row gives the traffic flow per timestep of 15 minutes. The first column is the time of day in hh:mm format follow by direction columns of traffic flow (NB, SB, EB, WB).\n",
    "***Theo remark***: they are hidden sheets! This is very important for the parsing!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***2015 Excel files*** The files come from Kimley Horn. Every excel file has 6 relevant sheets including the hidden sheets. They are ['ns Day 1', 'ns Day 2', 'ns Day 3', 'ew Day 1', 'ew Day 2', 'ew Day 3']. Depending on the direction of the road, the corresponding set of sheets are filled and the other half would be emtpy. Therefore, in the parsing algorithm, we first determine the flow direction, which then decide the set of sheets to parse. Each sheet is structured to have two tables side-by-side: Northbound(Eastbound) and Southbound(Westbound): in each table, the AM and PM flow are also side-by-side sharing the same column. Therefore, the algorithm would extract AM and PM flow first and stack them together to get traffic flow for the whole day. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***2017 Excel files*** are structured in one data sheet giving a header and a table for traffic flow. The header gives the start date and time of the recording, site code and sensor location, and the table gives traffic flow per a 15 minute timestep. The table's first two columns give the date and time and the following columns give traffic flow per directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***2017 PDF files*** are structured with a header and 3 tables of traffic flow data (one table per day of subsequent days). The header gives the site location and other miscellaneous meta data. Each table is titled by the date and timestep (15 minutes) of the recording. A table is organized by columns each representing the hour of day (0 - 23). Hence for a given column, the first row gives the hour of the day, the second gives the total flow for the hour, and the third to last row (4 rows total) gives traffic flow per 15 minute timestep for the hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***2019 Excel files*** have similar structure as those of 2013. The data is organized in two types of sheet, \"Day N\" and \"GR N\" sheets. The \"Day N\" sheets give traffic flow data in the same fashion as the \"DN\" sheets of 2013 excel files. The day of recording can be found in the header of the two tables. The \"GR N\" sheets plot the corresponding flow data of the \"Day N\" sheets. A line plot of flow vs. hour of day for different flow directions is given.\n",
